Solutions to Berkeley [CS-188 introduction to AI course](http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html) hometasks

While reading this code please keep in mind, that I don't aim nor perfecting of it in terms of readability nor in terms of PEP-8
complainty. I received a exercise book with fields and just filled them, in some places - very inaccurate. My aim was
to learn new and make WORKING code, that pass tests, not perfect code.

To run this you need to download supporting code for corresponding chapters from [pacman projects
section](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html) of site, unpack it and replace some files with those, in this
repository directories. Sometimes chapters depend one on another, if so stated in chapter README.md in this repository.
In such case you need to copy previous chapter code as well.

This code runs under python2, but examples in pacman projects starts with ```python ...```. You can both install
python2 and run it under ```python2...``` or create virtualenvironment with python2 as python. In both cases you need
python2.x
